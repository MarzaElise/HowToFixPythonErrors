# Lets say you want to import a module called 'discord'

import discord

# if that above line raises error, it means you havent installed it yet.
# since we know there is no spelling error in the name, lets install it.

# Open your terminal and type in any of the following commands, whichever works for you.

# pip install discord.py
# pip3 install discord.py
# python -m pip install discord.py
# python3 -m pip install discord.py

# This will install this module and you can now use it. if any of those commands errored with a text saying
# "python" is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program
# or anything similar, google "How to add python to PATH" and do so.

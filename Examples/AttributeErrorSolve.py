# So lets say we define a variable

a = 9

# and then do this

print(a.owo_this_attribute_doesnt_exist)

# this will raise AttributeError saying that int object has no attribute 'owo_this_attribute_doesnt_exist'

# always check for spelling errors 
# and make sure the given attribute exists by checking the relevent documentation

# **How To Fix Python Errors**
**This repo will contain a README with an explanation as to why the error is happening and how to fix it.**
-
1. **NameError**

    * This error is usually occuring because you haven't defined the variable and are just using it. 

    * To fix it you should define it like `VariableName = AnythingHere`.
        > * **Note. You mustn't define VariableName as another non existant variable. This will get you back to step one.**
    * Examples can be found in `./Examples`

2. **IndexError**
    * This error is usually raised when attempting to retrieve an index from a sequence and the index isn't found in the sequence.

    * To fix make sure the index is a number inside the sequence
        > * **Note. in python counts from 0 therefore one will be 0, two will be 1, three will be 2 and so on.**
    * Examples can be found in `./Examples`
